# Python Challenge ReadMe

## Background

It's time to step away from the Excel sheets and venture into the programming world with Python. This assignment presents two Python challenges, PyBank and PyPoll, offering real-world situations where your Python scripting skills will be put to the test.

## Before You Begin

Before diving into the assignment, ensure you follow these steps:

1. **Create a New Repository:** Establish a new repository for this project named `python-challenge`. Avoid adding this homework assignment to an existing repository.

2. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the newly created repository to your computer.

3. **Organize Folders:** Inside your local Git repository, create two folders, one for each Python assignment: PyBank and PyPoll.

4. **Folder Contents:**
   - Add a new file named `main.py` to each folder. This will serve as the main script for analysis.
   - Create a `Resources` folder in each directory containing the necessary CSV files. Ensure your script has the correct path to the CSV file.
   - Establish an `analysis` folder that holds a text file with the results from your analysis.

5. **Push Changes:** Push these changes to GitHub or GitLab.

## Files

Download the required files to kickstart your analysis: [Module 3 Challenge files](#).

## PyBank Instructions

In this challenge, your objective is to create a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company using the dataset `budget_data.csv`. The script should calculate the following values:

- Total number of months in the dataset
- Net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- Changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, along with the average of those changes
- Greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- Greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The final script should print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

## PyPoll Instructions

In this challenge, you are tasked with modernizing a small, rural town's vote-counting process using the dataset `election_data.csv`. The script should calculate the following values:

- Total number of votes cast
- Complete list of candidates who received votes
- Percentage of votes each candidate won
- Total number of votes each candidate won
- Winner of the election based on popular vote

The final script should print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

## Hints and Considerations

- Leverage your knowledge of importing modules like csv, reading and writing files, storing content in variables, lists, and dictionaries, iterating through data structures, and debugging.
- The datasets are intentionally large to highlight the limitations of Excel-based analysis. Python scripts provide more powerful options for handling big data.
- Write separate scripts for each dataset (PyBank and PyPoll) and run them independently to ensure functionality.
- Regularly commit your work and push changes to GitHub or GitLab to avoid data loss.

Remember to maintain a detailed README.md file in your repository. Happy coding!
